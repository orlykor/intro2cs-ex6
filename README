I discussed the exercise with: hofit bata, Gal kaplon

=============================
=  README for ex6- recursion
=============================

usage: python3.3 palindrome.py 
python3.3 balanced_brackets.py
python3.3 y_tree.py

==================
=  Description:  =
==================

palindrome- in this ex we needed to check if the given strings are in the form
of a palindrome or not. this means that if we can read the string from the 
begining to the end and also backwards. we needed to do first the whole word 
(recursivly) and in the 2nd func we needed to do it within given indexes.


balanced_brackets- 
in this ex, we needed to check in the first func if the given string is 
balanced or not. balanced means that if for every '(' we have his ')' partner. 
if it is, it returns true if not false.
we didnt need to use recursion over here.
#### in those next two funcs we needed to do recursive funcs ###
in the 2nd func we needed to check whether or not the string is balanced.
if it is it returns -1, if not, the inside func checks the index the problem
is in, if we need to fix it with '(' then it returns the index, if we need
to fix it with ')' then it returns the length.
in the 3rd func we needed to find matched brackets. first, the func checks if
the string is balanced, if not it return an empty list []. if it is then
it goes into the sub-func. this func returns the value of distance between a
pair of "()". for "(" positive num and for ")" negetive num. for other items 
0.

y_tree-
we needed to draw a tree recursviley using the turtle modoul.



test_strings_2a-c
tricked strings to check if the func is working correctly for complex strings.

======================


it was unclear whether we should put the defult length  200 (in ex 3) in the
func or assum that it is the len and thats what we will get to the func. 
i put it in but i wasnt sure what you mean. the opinions of my classmates were 
different.
